{"name":"FBDraft","body":"# Fantasy Baseball Auction\r\n\r\nThis is a web-app that imports CSV projections of hitters and pitchers and\r\npresents them in a sortable manner so that they may be assigned to fantasy teams.\r\n\r\nThe players, upon ingestion, are analyzed individually and in aggregate to determine\r\na player rating based on their projected statistical performance.  This rating\r\nis then used to calculate a market value for use in a fantasy baseball auction.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\nThe app makes heavy use of *CouchDB* as a document store and as a map-reduce engine.\r\n\r\nSearch is accomplished via *sunspot-solr*, which is definitely overkill.\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\n\r\nThe `fbdraft.yml` file contains the parameters that will be used to construct\r\nglobal constants used throughout the application.\r\n\r\nIf running multiple environments using this application (one for the AL and one for \r\nthe NL, for instance), then it will be necessary to have the Rails asset pipeline\r\nproperly configured so that *Twitter Bootstrap* loads the proper components.\r\n\r\n# Initialization\r\n\r\nThe `db/seeds.rb` file contains the script that will be used to import the CSV projection\r\ndata and map it onto the Couch model.  Once all players have been input, then\r\nstatistical analysis will begin of the whole player population and the players are then\r\nassigned ratings.  Once all the players have been rated, another round of updates will\r\napply auction dollar values to each player.","tagline":"Fantasy Baseball Draft Engine","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
